Python Automation Scripts Collection

Version: R1.00

<h2>Repository Purpose:</h2>
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a comprehensive collection of Python scripts designed for automating a range of tasks for my own personal usage. These scripts aim to enhance productivity, reduce manual effort, and streamline processes across various domains such as file management, data processing, system administration, and web automation. These all served their purpose and have avoided a lot of personal hours.

I am not a coder and these are by no means usable within a busines environment. Use at your own risk.
